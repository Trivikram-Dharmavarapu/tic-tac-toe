This project './server' develops a network-based tic-tac-toe game server enabling users to engage in tic-tac-toe games online.
It accommodates several clients simultaneously and includes functionalities such as user register and sign-in, the ability to observe games in progress,
user-to-user messaging, and fundamental player stats. This guide outlines steps for compiling and launching the server and provides details on known issues 
and how to demonstrate the server's capabilities.
